# Ring Doorbell redesign - Overview
#### *Goal of this project is to redesign a well-established product, using principles of HCI. It could be an embedded , mobile , or wearable interface. I chose to redesign Ring Doorbell.*
More details about this project can be found [here](Project-Ring%20(achauhan39%20v3).pdf)

### 1.	NeedFinding 

  a)	Created a needfinding plan to better understand strength, weaknesses, threat and opportunities for this  product. 
  b)	This plan defined problem space ,user-types and helped fill data-inventory.
  c)	Plan Execution and report conclusions.


### 2.	Heuristic Evaluation

  Critiqued what works and what doesnâ€™t, using design principles and ideas like Expert-Blindspot and Learning-Curves, and concepts like Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation.

### 3.	Interface Redesign and Justification 

  Insights gained from Heuristic Evaluation, interviews and product reviews led to several redesign ideas, which I clubbed to come up with three big ideas and presented a medium- to high-fidelity prototype
  1.	Video upload to local servers (Fig 4.1)
  2.	Face Detection enabling Intelligent Alerts  (Fig 4.2)
  3.	Voice-Alerts  facilitating touchless interaction ( Fig 4.3)

### 4.	Evaluation

 Performed qualitative evaluation (interview) of my aforementioned redesign, as it gave  me an opportunity to not only evaluate it from usability perspective in great detail but also probe user's thought on value-sensitivity of this design. The latter is important to me as one of the components of my redesign involves Face-recognition ,which has lately come under criticism for misidentifying people of color. Hence, I would like to get a deeper understanding of how user views usefulness (Intelligent Alerts) over value.
