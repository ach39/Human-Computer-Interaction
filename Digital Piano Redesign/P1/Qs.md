Processor model: It gives the user some input, which is the length of the word, the user then clicks a letter to fill in the word.  This user's ability to click can be measured.  If I was to evaluate this interface from the processor model, I'd check for how quickly I can choose a letter.   

 

Predictor model:  This concerns how well the user can predict their own actions.  For example, I predict that if I choose a correct letter, then the hangman game will show me all occurrences of that letter in the phrase.  If I choose an incorrect letter, the I predict that the game will draw a new part of my body to be "hung".  When evaluating the interface from this model, I would check for how accurately the interface fits my view of what should happen.

# Question 1 (from Lesson 2.1): ~1.5 pages
 As a Georgia Tech OMSCS student, you likely regularly use Canvas, Piazza, Udacity, and other tools. Select one of these interfaces (or one piece of one interface).

First, discuss that interface from the perspective of the processor model of the user. The processor model is concerned with objective, measurable outcomes, so note the efficiency with which you can accomplish different tasks.

Second, discuss that interface from the perspective of the predictor model of the user. The predictor model is concerned with what you predict will be the outcome of your action, and whether you can interpret whether the outcome matched your prediction, so focus on how the user perceives and interprets what they should do and whether it was successful.

Finally, compare the insights you gained from each of the previous discussions. What sorts of improvements would the processor model suggest, and how do they differ from the sorts of improvements that the predictor model would suggest?
Hint: Remember, the predictor model is not about interfaces predicting users’ intentions. The predictor model is about paying attention to what the user predicts the outcome of their action will be, and how they will interpret what they see after their action is complete. 


Piazza – following a post , pinned post , posts grouped by topics

Processor- talk about 
1)	Creating a Post – it allows questions , notes and polls
2)	Filtering data – Check unread posts , view favorites , pinned posts , folders
Predictor
1) Special formatting  not very useful (  predictor)

 
2) Doesn’t allow drag and drop of images or files ( predictor)

Compare - substantive qualitative behavioral predictions on the basis of a similarly quantitative analysis.

#Question 2 (from Lesson 2.1): ~1.5 pages
When we take the participant view of the user, we look at the entire context surrounding their activity. However, some interfaces are designed for activities that exist in different contexts.

First, select one activity you perform with a computer interface in multiple contexts. For example, you might use a text messaging app while walking down the street, sitting at your desk, eating a meal, or driving your car (though hopefully not!). You shouldn’t select text messaging: select some activity that is not used as an example in this question prompt.
Then, discuss how the different contexts surrounding the app add different constraints or challenges to using the app. For example, with a text messaging app, your cognitive resources are more divided eating or driving, and your physical precision is less reliable while walking.

Finally, describe how the design of the interface might be altered to perform differently depending on your context to overcome those constraints. You may assume that the interface is able to magically know your context. For example, if you were writing about text messaging, you could assume the app would know if you were driving, walking, or sitting.

Hint: Context can differ subtly and change rapidly. For example, driving a moving car and sitting at a stop light are two subtly different contexts. If you were writing about text messaging, you might note that the user’s eyes are diverted to the road while the car is moving, and so the phone cannot rely on the user seeing it. A redesign might let the user dictate text messages while driving, and be prepared to show them a large view of the draft message when the car stops at a stop light, allowing the user to quickly approve and send the message after checking for transcription errors.


Home security system – different context – when driving or in  a meeting or outside home
Sufficient when you are at home

1)	When Driving touch screen for password is not possible. So allow voice recognition with (paraphrase check)
2)	Door Bell – 
a.	‘someone is at the door’ – instead allow user to feed in pics of family and friends so that it can recognize.
b.	Display a text – user can send a text ( during a meeting)
c.	Extremely sensitive to motion on road. Lot of false positives
3)	It should learn just like NEST and during weekdays ‘ask user to lock the house’ if it’s not.

#Question 3 (from Lesson 2.2): ~1.5 pages
Describe the process of submitting an assignment to Canvas in terms of our discussion of feedback cycles.

For each of the three stages of the gulf of execution, describe how Canvas either successfully carries the student across that stage, or in what way it fails to carry the student across that stage. Assume the student does not already know exactly what to do: how does the system help them figure out what to do?

For each of the three stages of the gulf of evaluation, describe how Canvas successfully communicates the student the outcome of their action, or in what way it fails to communicate the outcome of their action. Again, assume that the student does not already know exactly what to expect.

Hint: Canvas allows assignment resubmission, so feel free to try this out with a draft of this assignment or a blank PDF. Feel free to describe an instance where the user fails at the task instead of where the user succeeds.

#Question 4 (from Lesson 2.2): ~1.5 pages
Select an activity from your regular life that struggles with a large gulf of execution or gulf of evaluation, especially due to a weakness of the interface involved in the activity. 
First, describe what makes that gulf wide. What are the failures of the current interface to bridge the gulf?

Then, select a similar activity from your regular life that does a better job bridging its gulf of execution or gulf of evaluation. Briefly describe that activity and what gives it a narrower gulf.

Finally, describe what lessons could be borrowed from the second activity’s interface to resolve the wide gulf in the first activity.

Hint: Make sure to select two different activities. They can be similar (two smartphone apps for different tasks, two different kitchen appliances, two different input devices), but they should not be the same exact task (two different game consoles, two different car navigation interfaces, two different smartphone operating systems). The goal is to redesign the weaker interface, not to describe how it was already redesigned to create the stronger interface.
