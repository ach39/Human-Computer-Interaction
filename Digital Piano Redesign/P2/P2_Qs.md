
# Q.1
1.1 briefly describe one of the processes by which people look up and enroll in classes at Georgia Tech. 

1.2 Then, describe a redesign of the system that more significantly leverages direct manipulation. 
/*Answer the question: how is this new way more “direct” than the current way? In answering, specifically comment on the new way using the vocabulary of direct manipulation covered in the lesson.*/



1.3 describe two specific benefits of this redesign. 
/* in what ways is it better? Is it more efficient, and if so, how is that measured? Is the user better able to cross the gulfs of execution and evaluation? Does the interface demonstrate a better understanding of the user’s knowledge and needs? */

# Q.2 
2.1 Select an task (besides driving) that you do on a regular basis that has become invisible by learning; that is, an interface that you used to spend a lot of time thinking about, but now ignore in favor of focusing on the task. 

Use tableau / RMAP

2.2 First, describe the components of the interface you used to think about a lot. 


2.3 Then, describe your thought process now, and especially explain why you no longer have to spend as much time focusing on the interface. 


2.4 Finally, briefly describe how you might design or redesign the computational interface to get you to the point of invisibility more quickly.

# Q.3 - Using an advanced treadmill

3.1 Using your chosen task domain, describe how each of these three types of human perception are used to give the user feedback.

Visual - On digital Display

Auditory - Beep as you are coming to an end, slowing down.

Haptic - user can feel its steep.

3.2 Then, for each type of these three types of human perception, design how that type of perception could be used to give feedback about something that does not currently use that modality. 

Visual - Dummy proof - too dangerous with current footwear. My profile via gym card. Preparing for marathon. Dispaly what I should be working on today and choose right workout rotuine for me and displays on the screen.

Auditory - As user is watching TV , auditory feedback on calories, heart rate  

Haptic - grooves on the belt when user going sideways

# Q.4 -  Multiple  Modalites

4.1 For each tip, select an interface from your everyday life that violates the suggestion. Briefly describe the interface.
My quesdilla machine.
Washing Machine

4.2 then describe violation of the tip. 


4.3 Then, briefly redesign the interface to incorporate the tip into its design.
offloads task from user interface :  Incorporate a timer that keeps track of time informs user that q is ready.
Multiple Modality - : My washing machine - inform user auditory + notification on phone or
