# OMSCS 
Pros
Courses or degree programs offered online have lower cost than traditional on-campus courses, which opens up oppurtunity for low-incoming students by removing financial barriers.it provides great deal of flexibility to students. Online classes can mold with student's scheudule and allow him to view lectures at times that works best for her, which is not possible in rigid schedule imposed by traditional education where student is expected to attend lecture at specific time. 


cons
This flexibility of online learning comes at a cost. Due to the way learning is structured in traditional vs online education, singificantly higher level of self-discipline and self-motivation is required at student's part to succeed in online setting.
Face to face interaction with insturctors and requirement to attend class as per scheudule, keeps student motivated and engaged.
With online education, there is barely any interaction with instructor. In 4 of the 8 classes I have taken with OMSCS class so far, Professor was completly detached from the class.One instructor didn't have any skills or expereince to manage a online class of 300 students. This severely degrades the quality of instructions or feedback student receives.It also impacts student's motivation level.


Design - 
Over the years, OMSCS program has made great strides in streamlining its courses and providing quality learning-material but it considerably lacks in fosterting quality interaction with intstrutors. Program can be restructed to give a feel of 'blended learning' where students get face time with Professor as in traditional setting , while maintiang the perks of online learning. Instrutor can hold office-hours once in 3-4 weeks which gives students oppurtunity for spur-of-the moment questioning. It will not only imporves socail interaction but may help better understand a concept.

Another way enhancing 'bleneded learning' in online setting is incorporate in-persion immersions at campus, where student gets to meet fellow students and faculty. This helps build meaningful realtionships, which platforms like piazzza and slack can't.

# political motivations are determining the design of technology

For two years (2014-2016), I worked on a project which required re-design of subscrier data management on cellular network. With explosion of mobile traffic in past decade, air-interface resources have become heavily congested,despite adding spectrum . Network wasn't simply able to keep with the demand, which impacted subscriber growth , cutting into company's bottomline. This suitation was worsened by existing subcribers who grandfathered (legacy) Unlimited data-plans, indiscriminatley hogging resoruces during all hours of the day . A new design and policy was required to established equity between these resource-hoggers and new subscribers with limited data-plans. Though well-intentioned, this design got into crosshairs with net-neutrality , which was a very hot topic in 2015.


There were several stakeholders in this long project.

# Piazza redesign

I personally find this interface quite usable and intuitive ... it takes after modern web browser design.
But I disappointed by its search capability.
My redesign for search capability in piazza and how reutls are presented to user.

1. Make search filters more discoverable. Search Tips appear after the some search is performed.
2. Make search keywords appear as bold when user selects a post from search-result and takes user to exactly where first instance of keyword appears.Currently keywords are bolded only is list of search-result that appear on left-pane and takes user to the top of the post.frustrating for threads that are very long

3. Allow multi-level search, where user can first filter posts by certain criteria ( say by folder or date) and then  perform search on this subset. Piazza doesn't support that.

4. One thing I wish Piazza had was the option to make certain comments/answers within  a post favorite. That way I can just filter on those, as I am preparing for exam or project. Currently you can 'favorite' entire post. It is not very helpful if that post becomes insanely long, which is not uncommon in this setting.


5. user the ability to hide messages. This would reduce clutter on the screen and not overwhelm the user with inofrmation overload. This would give the user more direct manipulation in the interface.


1. Displaying search-filters on main tab rather than in a drop-down, enhances discoverability. [Date , Relevance ]
2. Make it simplcity  rather than having user to remember the syntax  [Contributor , Title ]
2. Gulf of evaluation shrinks. Consistency with other popular search
3.
4. Flexibility to user in perform search based on crietria other than keywords. Builds affordance by showing a star sign
  
5. This would also help with the cognitive tasks of the user as they don’t have to remember the exact date the message was written

Summary


* why you selected this paper

For past few weeks I have been trying to finalize resdesign elements for my Project, which includes face-recognition. As I researched on this topic, I got intertested in learning more about how this technolgy presents ethical issues, how can we use it for human enablement, rather than as a disriminatory tool. Research shows Facial recognition technology’s difficulty identifying gender in people of color than in white people yet this technology is sold to law-enforment to police citizens, despite strict opposotion from ACLU and privacy advocates.
Reason I selected this paper is becauses it touches this core issue of how technology is (ab)used to govern/monitor people and  how we, as a designer, acknowledge and address these concerns in our design.
