## Redesign of Digital Piano

Goal of my research is to assess how digital piano/keyboard interface can be enhanced to make piano learning and practice engaging and effective for children. Primary user for this project are children who are learning piano and are main focus of my research. However, there are Secondary users ( parents and piano-teachers), who can also provide valuable insight into studentâ€™s learning needs. 

### 1. High level workflow of new interface

I used Music21 python library to create a sample work flow
  1. Program receives MIDI stream from Piano as student plays the song. 
  2. Program parses this data and compares it against original MIDI file (ground truth) for song being played. 
  3. It displays any differences in notes or timing on screen via red-dots.
